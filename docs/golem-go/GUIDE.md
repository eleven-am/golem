# Building with Golem

[QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md) gets one model running. This page covers what
you need for a real application: relations, authorization, queries, and
mutations. Its schema, policies and program are executed by
`TestGuideApplicationRuns`, so the code here is code that ran.

## Declaring models

A model is a Go struct. Blank fields carry table-level declarations; real
fields carry column ones.

```go
// notes/schema.go
package notes

import (
	"time"

	"github.com/eleven-am/golem/go/golem"
)

type Actor struct {
	UserID        golem.UUID
	Authenticated bool
}

type Author struct {
	_ struct{} `golem:"model;id=example.notes.Author;table=authors;graphql=Author"`
	_ struct{} `golem:"unique=uq_authors_handle(handle)"`

	ID     golem.UUID `db:"id" golem:"id=example.notes.Author.ID;pk;default=uuid"`
	Handle string     `db:"handle" golem:"type=varchar(40)"`
	Notes  []Note     `db:"-" golem:"relation=has_many;fields=id;references=author_id"`
}

type Note struct {
	_ struct{} `golem:"model;id=example.notes.Note;table=notes;graphql=Note"`
	_ struct{} `golem:"index=idx_notes_author(author_id,id)"`

	ID        golem.UUID `db:"id" golem:"id=example.notes.Note.ID;pk;default=uuid"`
	AuthorID  golem.UUID `db:"author_id" golem:"id=example.notes.Note.AuthorID"`
	Title     string     `db:"title" golem:"type=varchar(200)"`
	Published bool       `db:"published"`
	CreatedAt time.Time  `db:"created_at" golem:"default=now;readonly"`
	Author    *Author    `db:"-" golem:"relation=belongs_to;fields=author_id;references=id"`
}

func DefineSchema(schema *golem.Schema) {
	golem.SchemaName(schema, "notes")
	golem.Actor[Actor](schema)
	golem.Model[Author](schema)
	golem.Model[Note](schema)
	golem.Providers(schema, golem.SQLite)
}
```

### The tag vocabulary

On a blank `_ struct{}` field:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `model` | marks the struct as a model |
| `id=` | the canonical identity, stable across renames |
| `table=` | physical table name |
| `graphql=` | GraphQL type name |
| `unique=name(cols)` | unique constraint |
| `index=name(cols)` | index |

On a real field:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id=` | canonical field identity |
| `pk` | primary key |
| `default=uuid` / `default=now` | value golem supplies on create when the field is not written; no column `DEFAULT` is emitted |
| `readonly` | cannot be written by any caller |
| `updated` | set to the mutation time on every update of the row, including one whose values equal the stored ones |
| `immutable` | writable on create, never on update |
| `type=` | physical column type |
| `hidden` | excluded from the generated API |
| `writeonly` | writable, never readable |
| `relation=has_many` / `has_one` / `belongs_to` / `many_to_many` | relation kind |
| `fields=` / `references=` | the local and foreign columns joining it |

`db:"-"` marks a field as having no column of its own, which every relation
needs.

## Authorization

Every exposed model must declare a policy, and there is no implicit allow.
A policy receives the resolved actor and grants against predicates.

```go
// notes/policies.go
package notes

import "github.com/eleven-am/golem/go/golem"

func (Author) DefinePolicy(rules *golem.Rules[Author], actor Actor) {
	rules.CanRead(golem.All[Author]())
	if actor.Authenticated {
		rules.CanCreate(golem.All[Author]())
	}
}

func (Note) DefinePolicy(rules *golem.Rules[Note], actor Actor) {
	published := Notes.Published.Eq(true)
	if !actor.Authenticated {
		rules.CanRead(published)
		return
	}
	own := Notes.AuthorID.Eq(actor.UserID)
	rules.CanRead(published.Or(own))
	rules.CanCreate(own)
	rules.CanUpdate(own)
	rules.CanDelete(own)
}
```

`Notes` and `Authors` are generated accessors. A policy is a *predicate*, not a
callback: golem compiles it into the SQL of every query, so an unauthorized row
is never read rather than read and filtered.

`rules.CanReadFields(predicate, Notes.Title)` and `CannotReadFields` narrow
authorization to individual columns.

A unique constraint is the one place a write can reveal a row you cannot read.
Suppose you create or update a row and the value collides with a unique key or
primary key held by a row outside your read policy. The database still rejects
the write, and golem reports it as `CONFLICT`, which tells you the value is
taken. That is inherent to the constraint. The collision is checked across
every row, and hiding it would mean accepting a write that cannot be stored. If
the taken values themselves are secret, such as emails or handles, make the key
opaque, scope it with a composite key that includes the owner, or route the
write through a system-client flow that answers the same way either way.
Foreign keys do not leak like this: you can link only to a row you can read,
and golem reports a row you cannot read exactly as a row that does not exist.

`RelationOptions(...).OnDelete(golem.Cascade)` tells golem that a dependent
row's lifetime belongs to its parent. If you may delete the parent, that
permission covers every row the cascade removes, including rows owned by other
users and rows you cannot read. `SetNull` works the same way: deleting the
parent clears the reference on each dependent without checking a policy on
that row. Golem locks the affected rows before the parent is deleted and emits
a change event for each one: a deleted event for every cascaded row and an
updated event for every cleared reference, in the same transaction as the
delete. Each subscriber still receives only the events its own read policy
allows. A delete whose cascade would touch more rows than
`MutationLimits.MaxTouchedRows` allows (1,000 by default) is refused.

## Callers and the system client

```go
caller, err := application.ForPrincipal(ctx, Principal{UserID: id, Authenticated: true})
system := application.System()
```

`ForPrincipal` resolves your principal into an `Actor` and applies policy to
everything it does. `System()` bypasses policy entirely — use it for seeding,
migrations and background work, never for a request.

## Reading

```go
all, err := caller.Notes.FindMany(ctx, notes.Notes.Where(golem.All[notes.Note]()))
drafts, err := caller.Notes.FindMany(ctx, notes.Notes.Where(notes.Notes.Published.Eq(false)))
one, err := caller.Notes.FindUnique(ctx, notes.Notes.ByID.Value(id))
```

Predicates compose with `.Or(...)`, `.And(...)`, and `golem.All[T]()` matches
everything the policy already permits. `Where` requires a predicate — there is
no argument-free form, because "no filter" and "everything I may see" are
different statements and golem makes you write the second one.

## Writing

```go
author, err := system.Authors.Create(ctx,
	notes.Authors.Create(notes.Authors.Handle.Create("ada")),
	notes.Authors.Select(notes.Authors.ID),
)
```

Each field is set through its own builder, so a field that is `readonly` or
absent from the schema cannot be written by construction.

### Mutations return only what you select

This is the API's sharpest edge. A mutation returns a `Row` containing
**nothing** unless you pass a projection:

```go
author, _ := system.Authors.Create(ctx, notes.Authors.Create(notes.Authors.Handle.Create("ada")))
id, present := golem.Value(author, notes.Authors.ID).Get()
// present == false — not even the identity is there
```

Pass `notes.Authors.Select(notes.Authors.ID)` and it is. The same applies to
`Update`, `Upsert` and `Delete`.

`Get()` returns the value **and whether it is present**. Absent-because-not-
selected and absent-because-policy-masked are deliberately indistinguishable,
so a caller cannot discover a field exists by watching it vanish. Ignore the
second return and you get a zero value you cannot explain.

## What it does

```go
// cmd/notes/main.go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"example.com/notes/notes"
	"github.com/eleven-am/golem/go/golem"
	"github.com/eleven-am/golem/go/provider/sqlite"
)

type Principal struct {
	UserID        golem.UUID
	Authenticated bool
}

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()
	database, err := sqlite.Open(ctx, sqlite.Config{DataSourceName: "file:notes.db"})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer database.Close()

	application, err := notes.Open(ctx, notes.Config[Principal]{
		Database: database,
		ResolvePrincipal: func(_ context.Context, principal Principal) (notes.Actor, error) {
			return notes.Actor{UserID: principal.UserID, Authenticated: principal.Authenticated}, nil
		},
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	system := application.System()
	author, err := system.Authors.Create(ctx,
		notes.Authors.Create(notes.Authors.Handle.Create("ada")),
		notes.Authors.Select(notes.Authors.ID),
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	authorID, ok := golem.Value(author, notes.Authors.ID).Get()
	if !ok {
		log.Fatal("create returned no identity")
	}

	caller, err := application.ForPrincipal(ctx, Principal{UserID: authorID, Authenticated: true})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	for _, note := range []struct {
		title     string
		published bool
	}{{"published note", true}, {"draft note", false}} {
		if _, err := caller.Notes.Create(ctx, notes.Notes.Create(
			notes.Notes.AuthorID.Create(authorID),
			notes.Notes.Title.Create(note.title),
			notes.Notes.Published.Create(note.published),
		)); err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
	}

	mine, err := caller.Notes.FindMany(ctx, notes.Notes.Where(golem.All[notes.Note]()))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	anonymous, err := application.ForPrincipal(ctx, Principal{})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	visible, err := anonymous.Notes.FindMany(ctx, notes.Notes.Where(golem.All[notes.Note]()))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	drafts, err := caller.Notes.FindMany(ctx, notes.Notes.Where(notes.Notes.Published.Eq(false)))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("author=%d anonymous=%d drafts=%d\n", len(mine), len(visible), len(drafts))
}
```

```
author=2 anonymous=1 drafts=1
```

The author sees their published note and their draft. An anonymous caller sees
only the published one — not because the program filtered, but because the
policy predicate was compiled into the query. The draft filter finds one row.

## Changing a schema

Editing a model means a new migration before regeneration:

```
golem migration new --schema ./notes --name add-author
golem generate --schema ./notes --app-out ./notes
golem migration apply --provider sqlite --dsn "file:notes.db"
```

`golem migration plan` shows what a migration will do before it runs, and
`golem check --app-out ./notes` fails when generated code no longer matches
the schema — run it in CI.

## Errors you will meet early

| Error | Cause |
|---|---|
| `P1_BINDING_POLICY_REQUIRED` | an exposed model has no `DefinePolicy` |
| `generated applications require a reviewed non-empty migration history` | `generate` ran before `migration new` |
| `CONFLICT: mutation conflicted` | a unique constraint rejected the write |
